# prob statement - find the next 4 leap years after user input
'''
if the year is a century year i.e divisible by 100, such year
you divide by 400 - then if the remainder is ZERO - it is LEAP
if the year is NOT century year i.e. when divided by 100 the remainder is
not 0 then it is not century year
such year you divide by 4 and if the remainder is ZERO then
it is LEAP year
